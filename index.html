                This will be the page used as an academic project for the web development class.

                My name is Nuno Rodrigues and I am a UI product owner and front-end developer in a rail critical software development company called THALES.

                My professional and academic background was completely based on design and fine arts having the stating point at a equipment design degree with a solid focus on human centric ergonomics that lead me into a bachelor in design at IADE. Still having a strong interest in design I felt that I had a big passion by science too. 
                
                Given my path of doubts about my future, I decided to embrace a more technological path by engaging a development course. I made sense given that at this point I was already working as web designer and developer at a eLearning company.

                After a couple of years I was completely emersed by the web development world and wanted to complete my academic path based on this knowledge. Life and fear were some of the anchors of not doing it for a few years but when I started as a front-end developer at THALES I lost my fear of embracing an engineering degree and here I am today trying to complete my personal goal of becoming a Computer science engineer.
